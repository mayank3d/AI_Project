Slither Link Game Code.

 Steps to run the Code:

enter your move in the form of a triplet: solve


Note:
-Use only triplet N N L to enter your move. Read instruction upon running game for more details.

-Use only lower case letters for entering moves.

-Lisp version used for development: Allergo CL 9.0 Free express edition.

-My version of LISP used forward slash (/) for entering filename. Take into account what your LISP uses.

-The slither.lisp and game board file either needs to be put in default directory of LISP or entire file path is required.
